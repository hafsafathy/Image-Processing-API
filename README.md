# Image-Processing-API
I create and initialize a TypeScript project from scratch.
I  create and initialize express and Jasmine from scratch.

I set up our TypeScript configuration file and prepare my project for transpilation.
I make a coherent express file structure that promotes scalability using express router.

I then added eslint and prettier to our project and learned how to connect them together to work with a single script.
I then added prettier and went through the basic configuration and created the required file structure.

I finally configure eslint and prettier with our custom rules.
I finally  make unit tests that makes sense and make unit tests for our endpoints.
